## RLS POLICY DEBUGGING - MANDATORY PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL**: When debugging Row Level Security (RLS) policy issues in Supabase/Postgres:

### STEP 1: ALWAYS CHECK WHAT EXISTS FIRST ⚠️

Before attempting to drop or modify ANY RLS policy, you MUST use MCP:

Use `mcp_supabase_READ-ONLY_execute_sql` with query:
```sql
SELECT 
  policyname,
  cmd,
  qual,
  with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'table_name';
```

**NEVER ASSUME POLICY NAMES!** Policy names might be:
- ❌ "gig_roles_select_policy" (what you expect)
- ✅ "Users can view gig roles for their projects" (what actually exists)

### STEP 2: DROP USING EXACT NAMES

Use the EXACT policy names from the query above:

```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Actual Policy Name From Database" ON table_name;
```

### STEP 3: WATCH FOR CIRCULAR DEPENDENCIES

If you see "infinite recursion detected in policy" errors:

1. **Identify the cycle**: Table A checks Table B, Table B checks Table A
2. **Break the cycle**: Make ONE table's policies permissive
3. **Common pattern**: 
   - `gigs` ↔ `gig_roles` circular dependency
   - Solution: Make `gig_roles` permissive, keep `gigs` strict

### STEP 4: VERIFY AFTER CHANGES

After modifying policies, always verify using MCP:

Use `mcp_supabase_READ-ONLY_execute_sql` with queries:
```sql
-- Check policies were actually dropped/created
SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'table_name';

-- Test a query
SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 1;
```

### WHY THIS MATTERS

**What happened**: We spent 2+ hours debugging RLS issues because we:
1. ❌ Assumed policy names instead of checking
2. ❌ Tried to drop policies that didn't exist
3. ❌ The REAL buggy policies kept running
4. ❌ Got the same error 7+ times

**What fixed it**: 
1. ✅ Queried `pg_policies` to see actual names
2. ✅ Dropped the CORRECT policies
3. ✅ Fixed immediately

### MANDATORY CHECKLIST

Before providing ANY RLS fix:

- [ ] Have you used `mcp_supabase_READ-ONLY_execute_sql` to query `pg_policies` for actual policy names?
- [ ] Are you using the EXACT names from the database (not assumed names)?
- [ ] Have you checked for circular dependencies between tables?
- [ ] Have you provided verification queries using MCP tools?

**If you answer NO to any of these, STOP and use MCP tools to get the information first!**

## ARCHITECTURAL CHANGES - COMPREHENSIVE IMPACT CHECK

**CRITICAL**: When making changes that affect core data structures, column names, types, or API contracts, you MUST perform a COMPREHENSIVE impact analysis BEFORE making any changes.

### Trigger Conditions (When to Apply This Protocol)

Apply this protocol when making ANY of these changes:
- ✅ Dropping/renaming database columns
- ✅ Changing table schemas (adding NOT NULL, foreign keys, etc.)
- ✅ Modifying TypeScript interfaces/types used across multiple files
- ✅ Changing API function signatures
- ✅ Altering data relationships (1:1 to 1:many, etc.)
- ✅ Removing or renaming properties from shared types
- ✅ Changing authentication/authorization logic

### MANDATORY PROTOCOL: The 7-Step Check

**STEP 1: SEARCH FIRST, CODE LATER**

Before making ANY changes, run comprehensive searches:

```bash
# Search for the exact column/property/function name
grep -r "old_column_name" /path/to/codebase

# Search for patterns (property access)
grep -r "\.old_column_name" /path/to/codebase
grep -r "old_column_name\?" /path/to/codebase

# Search in specific critical areas
grep "old_column_name" lib/types/
grep "old_column_name" lib/api/
grep "old_column_name" components/
grep "old_column_name" app/
```

**STEP 2: DOCUMENT ALL OCCURRENCES**

Create a comprehensive list:
- File path
- Line number
- Context (what the code does)
- Required change

**STEP 3: IDENTIFY THE LAYERS**

Group occurrences by layer:
1. **Database Layer** (migrations, RLS policies, functions)
2. **Type Layer** (database.ts, shared types, interfaces)
3. **API Layer** (lib/api/*, queries, mutations)
4. **Component Layer** (UI components using the data)
5. **Page Layer** (app routes consuming the data)

**STEP 4: FIX IN CORRECT ORDER**

Apply fixes in this exact order:
1. Database migration (schema change)
2. Type definitions (database.ts, shared types)
3. API layer (data access functions)
4. Components (reusable UI)
5. Pages (route handlers and page components)

**STEP 5: VERIFY EACH LAYER**

After fixing each layer, verify:
```bash
# Check for linter errors
npm run lint

# Search again to confirm no references remain
grep -r "old_name" src/

# Run type checking
npm run type-check (if available)
```

**STEP 6: TEST CRITICAL PATHS**

After all changes, test:
- ✅ Create operations
- ✅ Read/fetch operations  
- ✅ Update operations
- ✅ Delete operations
- ✅ Related features that use the changed data

**STEP 7: FINAL COMPREHENSIVE GREP**

Before declaring complete, run final searches:
```bash
# Search for any remaining references
grep -ri "old_column" ./ --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git

# Search for common patterns
grep -r "\.old_column" ./lib ./app ./components
grep -r "data\.old_column" ./
grep -r "old_column:" ./
```

### ENFORCEMENT: Zero-Tolerance Policy

❌ **DO NOT** make changes incrementally as errors appear  
❌ **DO NOT** fix only what's broken and move on  
❌ **DO NOT** assume "that's probably all of them"  
✅ **DO** perform the complete 7-step check UPFRONT  
✅ **DO** fix ALL occurrences in a single comprehensive pass  
✅ **DO** verify no references remain before declaring done  

### Example: Removing a Column

**BAD APPROACH (What NOT to do):**
```
1. Drop column in migration ❌
2. Wait for error in frontend ❌
3. Fix that one file ❌
4. Wait for next error ❌
5. Fix that file ❌
6. Repeat 10 more times ❌❌❌
```

**GOOD APPROACH (What TO do):**
```
1. Search for ALL references to column ✅
2. Document all 15 occurrences found ✅
3. Create fix plan for each layer ✅
4. Apply migration ✅
5. Fix all 15 references systematically ✅
6. Verify with grep - 0 results ✅
7. Test and confirm working ✅
```

### Why This Matters

**What happened**: Removed `owner_id` column from gigs table but didn't check all references. Result:
- 🔥 Spent 2+ hours fixing errors one by one
- 🔥 Found references in 12+ different files
- 🔥 User had to explicitly ask for comprehensive check
- 🔥 Fixed: database.ts, dashboard-gigs.ts, gig-pack.ts, gig-roles.ts, gigs page, gig detail page, etc.

**What should have happened**: 
- ✅ Run grep for `owner_id` before making ANY changes
- ✅ Found all 21 occurrences across 5 files immediately
- ✅ Fixed all at once in one systematic pass
- ✅ Verified with final grep showing 0 results
- ✅ Done in 20 minutes instead of 2+ hours

### Checklist Before Declaring "Done"

- [ ] Have you run comprehensive grep searches for the old name?
- [ ] Have you checked ALL layers (DB, types, API, components, pages)?
- [ ] Have you fixed type definitions (database.ts, shared types)?
- [ ] Have you updated all API functions?
- [ ] Have you updated all components?
- [ ] Have you verified with a final grep showing 0 results?
- [ ] Have you tested the actual feature end-to-end?

**If you answer NO to ANY of these, you are NOT done!**
